# DogApp-Compose-Ktor
Simple Android App that uses local back-end service (Ktor)

As base url, using IPv4 address works on Android emulator perfectly( http://192.168.1.2:8080 ) same as in back-end service. 
There are some issues when we try to use localhost instead of IPv4 address( http://localhost:8080 ).
If you use an application on port 8080 switch it to another.
